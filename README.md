# cardsim
A program in Java simulating card games.

Meant both for fun and to allow the comparison of playing strategies objectively.
More implementations of players will be added over time.

The first game implemented is Spades, however the project was inspired by Durak,
and so Durak too will hopefully be implemented eventually.
